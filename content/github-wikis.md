I struggle to come up with a single thing that github wikis do better than
mkdocs material or vitepress.
Why are they being kept in a separate repo?
Why does that repo reinvent the wheel by providing some of the web UI features that
normal source code repos have, but worse in every way?

Wikis do not provide a global search, the outline is hidden in one of the two
sidebars, they are quite slow and are restricted to what github markdown
supports in terms of features.
