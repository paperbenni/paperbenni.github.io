# Modernizing instantASSIST

instantASSIST is probably my most used instantOS utility. It provides emacs-like
keyboard shortcut sequences (chorded keybindings) for doing a variety of tasks for which I do not want
to interrupt what I am doing. There is one problem with it though: instantMENU
is stuck on X11. These days Wayland is less and less optional, and that makes
using any X11 software for latency critical tasks a problem.
