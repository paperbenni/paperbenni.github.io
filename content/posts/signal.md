My thoughts on Signal

I dislike the way images are handled immensely. 
If someone sends you an image it gets stored within Signal. Nothing else can
access it, just like your text and voice messages. For those, the approach makes
sense. You will only need your text messages within Signal, and even if you
don't, then Signal 


separate storage for oictures?
no handling on duplifates?
no way to save by default?

No tablet companion app for android



no bots?
phone number required?
