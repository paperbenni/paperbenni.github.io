My thoughts on Signal

I dislike the way images are handled immensely. 
If someone sends you an image it gets stored within Signal. Nothing else can
access it, just like your text and voice messages. For those, the approach makes
sense. You will only need your text messages within Signal, and even if you
don't, then Signal is a fine way to view them. 
Images are a different story however. I would argue that the vast majority of
users use them outside of signal. They might want to view them all in a grid or
timeline, not grouped by the person who sent them, but grouped by time or the
content od the pixture. 
You may want to edit them. You might want albums. You might want to view your
pictures on different devixes. 
I am very sceptical of the isea that how most people view their images is by
remembering who sent them a spexifix image, foing to thar xhat, opening the
media section, clicking on "all images" and then scrolling up a bunch. 
It is far more likely that even the most tech illiterate grabdma has a better
experience with a gallery. And cor any more advanced user, backups, deleting
photos from a device once backed up, sesrching and editing are features they
cannog go without. 

Tech-illiterate users might be wonderijg why the images whicj someone sent to
them are not showing up in their phpyos app. This is the default behavior for
any other common messaging app, whatsapp, imessage, google messages, telegram,
and if youre not interested in techbology, then the idea of it being different
will not eveb occur to you. 

Signal needs to appeal to tech illiterate people. the value of a messenger lies in
how many people you are able to reach.
