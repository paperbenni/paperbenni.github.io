# Images

I dislike the way images are handled immensely. 
If someone sends you an image it gets stored within Signal. Nothing else can
access it, just like your text and voice messages. For those, the approach makes
sense. You will only need your text messages within Signal, and even if you
don't, then Signal is a fine way to view them. 
Images are a different story however. I would argue that the vast majority of
users use them outside of Signal. They might want to view them all in a grid or
timeline, not grouped by the person who sent them, but ordered and grouped by time or the
content of the picture.
You may want to edit them. You might want albums. You might want to view your
pictures on different devices.
I am very skeptical of the idea that how most people view their images is by
remembering who sent them a specific image, going to that chat, opening the
media section, clicking on "all images" and then scrolling up a bunch. 
It is far more likely that even the most tech illiterate grandma has a better
experience with a gallery. And for any more advanced user, backups, deleting
photos from a device once backed up, searching and editing are features they
cannot go without.

Tech-illiterate users might be wondering why the images which someone sent to
them are not showing up in their photos app. This is the default behavior for
any other common messaging app, whatsapp, imessage, google messages, telegram,
and if you're not interested in technology, then the idea of it being different
will not even occur to you.

Signal needs to appeal to tech illiterate people. the value of a messenger lies in
how many people you are able to reach. Few people use WhatsApp because of its
innovative features or because they like Facebook and training its LLMs. They
use it because their family and friends use it, and they also only use it
because their family and friends use it. I do not want to choose the people I am
in contact with by checking who uses what messenger. It is not that important to
me. I use WhatsApp because I know I will not be able to convince everyone to
switch, and I use Signal with the people who have it. 

If Signal has a reputation of only being for people who like to mess with their
devices, then it will not get the mass adoption it needs to truly replace
proprietary messengers. 

# Android Tablets

How is there no compantion app for Android? WhatsApp has one, there's one for
iPadOS, Windows, Linux and MacOS. Android tablets get the full version of
Signal, which might be nice to have as an option, but since that requires
logging out of Signal on my phone, it's not an option for me and I would guess
most other people who own a phone. 

separate storage for pictures?
no handling on duplicates?
no way to save by default?

No tablet companion app for Android


# No Bots

This one is more of a nitpick

no bots?
phone number required?


# I like Signal

Signal, despite its flaws, is currently the best messenger on the market. It has
more mass appeal than Discord, less crazy people and shady business practices
than Telegram, and most importantly it feels like a clone of SMS but better,
which means I can easily install it on my grandma's phone and all she notices is
that some things are now blue. 

It is open source, it is not a rugpull, it is secure, it is free and funded by
donations. 

It is stable. Rock solid. You can always rely on your messages getting where
they need to be, and that it will notify you if there are messages. The fact
that discord calls still do not make your phone ring proves that this is not a
trivial problem to solve. 

It has less downtime that WhatsApp. In fact, I have never seen it go down for a
noticeable amount of time. Not being tied to a company whose motto includes
'move fast and break things' is a huge plus for a pretty basic tool. 

I do not believe the problems I have outlined here are impossible to solve, but
what frustrates me is that they have been there for years and apparently nobody
cares.
