My thoughts on Signal

I dislike the way images are handled immensely. 
If someone sends you an image it gets stored within Signal. Nothing else can
access it, just like your text and voice messages. For those, the approach makes
sense. You will only need your text messages within Signal, and even if you
don't, then Signal is a fine way to view them. 
Images are a different story however. I would argue that the vast majority of
users use them outside of signal. They might want to view them all in a grid or
timeline, not grouped by the person who sent them, but grouped by time or the
content of the picture.
You may want to edit them. You might want albums. You might want to view your
pictures on different devices.
I am very skeptical of the idea that how most people view their images is by
remembering who sent them a specific image, going to that chat, opening the
media section, clicking on "all images" and then scrolling up a bunch. 
It is far more likely that even the most tech illiterate grandma has a better
experience with a gallery. And for any more advanced user, backups, deleting
photos from a device once backed up, searching and editing are features they
cannot go without.

Tech-illiterate users might be wondering why the images which someone sent to
them are not showing up in their photos app. This is the default behavior for
any other common messaging app, whatsapp, imessage, google messages, telegram,
and if you're not interested in technology, then the idea of it being different
will not even occur to you.

Signal needs to appeal to tech illiterate people. the value of a messenger lies in
how many people you are able to reach.
