Is GPT-5-mini the new GitHub Copilot base model?


If it is, then I'm worried. GPT-5 is better than 4.1, but even that is debatable. But GPT-5-mini as a replacement for it seems odd. 
GPT-5 is cheaper to run than 4.1 is. It seems the logical sucessor to 4.1
This doesn't feel like progress.
Real progress isn't a new product offering the same quality at the same price, with the the option to pay exorbitant sums of money for a slightly better experience.
