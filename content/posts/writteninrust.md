title: 'Why I consider "written in Rust" a feature'

Being written in Rust is a feature and I'm tired of pretending it's not. 

Projects often like to put "written in Rust" in the title, and most of the time
I often see people claim that this is just to jump on the hype train of 'shiny new
thing' or to appeal to the cult of Rust. (Or because they're part of the cult)

I disagree with that take. Writing Rust can be slow

It is easy to write a javascript program. It is hard to write one which does its
job well if that job has any reliability or performance constraints. 


uv vs pip
deno vs node

It means someone put in the work



Speed


General viability

python
- huge
- slow
- bad async
- pain in the ass to set up
    - venv
    - pipenv
    - uv
    - pyenv
    - virtualenv

examples
- ranger
- oci cli
- openstack

nodejs
- node_modules huge
- slow startup times
- tends to break
- no native packages
- examples
    - nest js cli
    - npm
    - husky

JS/Python
after some complexity, development slows
