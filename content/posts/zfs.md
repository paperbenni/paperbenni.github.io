# My adventures in ZFS

Sometimes I wish software would have a list of features that new users would
expect to exist and be very basic, but which do not exist and will likely never
do. 

I refused to look at ZFS for a long time because it seemed like a rabbit hole I
could spend days going down, and until now I was quite happy with btrfs. 

ZFS does not support renaming a pool. I can export and reimport it with a new
name, but I cannot change the name. 

I cannot shrink ZFS vdevs
