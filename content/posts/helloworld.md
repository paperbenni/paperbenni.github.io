# Hello world

This is my first post. Setting this site up was way more work than I
anticipated. Jekyll seems a bit old school, its website hasn't changed ever
since I first came across it.
GitHub pages is older than GitHub Actions, but pages was sort of absorbed
into actions. In order to keep compatibility with older repos, they added some
ghost jobs to the site (?)

Also my custom domain just got erased from the settings, or they added the
settings page after I added the custom domain in some other way. That was
ages ago, I don't really remember. 

It is sort of cool though that needing to spend half an hour setting this up is
a lot for me nowadays. I once tried getting to grips with hugo and just gave
up because a lot of parts of it required knowledge I didn't have and I didn't
consider reading up on them worth the effort. Years later, I seem to have picked
that knowledge up without realizing, no part of this war particularly
hard and I didn't feel like I used any extensive knowledge.
