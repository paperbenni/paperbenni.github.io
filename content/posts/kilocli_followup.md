# A surprise to be sure

I disliked the old CLI, and as it turns out so did the developers behind it, and
they replaced it with an OpenCode fork. 



I want mobile support

I want bun on mobile

Coding agents have made coding on mobile viable
Typing is no longer the bottleneck

Termux is not a toy anymore

I want kilo in the ACP registry for Zed

Slash commands do not show keyboard hints, ctrl p menu does though Is kilo
web/desktop a thing? `kilo web` does work, but the web interface is still
entirely the opencode branding

I want the web version to keep being a thing (not just tauri/electron)
I dislike using web-based tech because there's always a certain jank to it that
isn't there with good (emphasis on good) TUIs. The feeling of typing in neovim
is just different than with VS Code with the neovim plugin. The terminal
emulator just needs to do font rendering, nothing else. And it does a better job
at it than Chromium. I'm sorry, that's just the case. 
Compared to a browser, a terminal emulator is trivial. It really does not do a
lot. Kitty and Ghostty still spend insane amounts of time on optimizing the few
things a terminal emulator does and it shows.

# Termux support

Claude code works well on mobile through npm
Claude code is breaking npm support, 'native' version does not work on Termux
