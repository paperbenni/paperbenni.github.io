# Google Antigravity impressions

TLDR; Awful, absolutely awful. 

The only possibly redeeming quality for this is that it has free Gemini 3, but
even that is horrendously implemented. 

## Rate limits

The rate limits kick in after 1 to 4 prompts (4 is the maximum I got and 2 of
those were just "continue" because the agent stopped without any apparent
reason). Switching to Gemini 3 Low gets you another 3 prompts before it breaks. 
And break it does in many different ways. 


## Broken windowing

The application is meant to be used in multi window mode, there's an agent
manager and an editor. If you close the editor but leave the agent manager,
things completely bug out. 


There is no syntax highlighting in the agent manager. 


## Change just for the sake of it

All VS Code forks are shy about the fact that they didn't create 99% of what
you're seeing, so they change things just to make that less obvious. None of
these changes are improvements or provide any value or reason to exist. 

The sidebar for VS Code is fine. Stop messing with it, it looks worse and
behaves really weird.
