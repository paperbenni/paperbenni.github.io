# Introduction

Time to make another software wishlist.
This time the wishlist has some smaller open source software, and the features
are less obvious, but I would still very much like to have them.
Maybe I will even update this list if the features are added or if I get around
to adding them myself. 

# Snacks.nvim

This is a plugin suite for neovim which has a remarkable amount of features with
remarkable quality. 

The file explorer should have the ability to choose the window in which to open
a new file. It is not entirely clear how the explorer chooses the window in
which to open a file, but coc and nvim-tree both have the same buffer picker. I
am not sure if this is from a plugin or if it is built in, regardless, I would
love the ability to use it with the snacks explorer. 

# mini.nvim

Another plugin suite, also very well done. 

## mini.files

This currently acts odd if you try to open telescope or snack picker. 
The picker appears for a second, but then both mini.files and the picker
disappear. Opening the picker again then works. Maybe mini.files should close
when pickers are open or find a way to stay open in the background.
I do not know if this is technically even possible, or if this is a neovim
issue, but it is annoying.
