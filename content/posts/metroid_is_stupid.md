First puzzle is: door is closed and cannot be opened The solution is: Go to the
left, find another obstacle which cannot be overcome. Then go to the right
again, and the door which previously could not be opnened cannot be opened. 

You haven't gained a key or any ability to open the door, or you haven't
triggered any mechanism which could open the door. The logical thing to assume
is that until any of these things have happened, there's no use in checking the
door again. 

There's no problem solving to this.  It just can magically be opened because you
went to the left. You get taught very early on that thinking will not get you
anywhere, sometimes the answer is to just try random shit which solves your
problems in a way you will not understand.

This means that I will frequently have to just run a round pressing random
buttons, which on its own is annoying, but combined with the fact that all
enemies respawn when I leave and reenter a room it becomes pretty unfun. The
enemies are not hard to fight, and you encounter them often enough that the way
to fight each of them becomes very obvious and easy. But it does take time every
single time. All the combat does is slow you down. It's repetitive enough for
you to not want to do it for its own sake, and you don't gain any resources from
it except the health and missiles you depleted by engaging in it in the first
place.
