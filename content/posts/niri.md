# Niri

I have recently come across [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri).

I do not know how I managed to miss that this is a thing for this long. 
In my limited experience this is even better than Hyprland.

# Overview hjkl

The overview mode is amazing. It would be even amazinger if you could use hjkl
vim navigation in addition to the arrow keys. This should be fairly simple

# XWayland

XWayland is a bit rough on niri. instantmenu spawns on the wrong workspace and
sometimes behind normal tiled windows. Sometimes it also opens in a window even
though it is supposed to render above other windows, not inside one. I do not
know if this is a problem with xwayland-satellite or niri, but sadly it makes
X11-based menus nearly unusable.

# Dynamic workspaces

Maybe this is just personal preference but I do not think dynamic workspaces
make sense for keybinds which have a specific number on it.

1. Press Mod+4
2. Open an application
3. Press Mod+1
4. I want to go back to the application, so I press Mod+4
5. Go hunting for the application. It turns out to be on workspace 3 because it was empty

This requires you to constantly mentally keep track of your workspaces, because
the meaning of the keybinds which switch workspaces constantly changes.

# GitHub wikis

I much prefer VitePress or MkDocs Material over GitHub wikis.
They provide search, better performance, navigation, and styling.
I would love for niri to switch to one of these.
