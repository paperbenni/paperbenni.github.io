Hosting Forgejo is easy
Forgejo CI works well
Gitea CI works well
GitLab CI works well

All of the forks are better maintained than GitHub CI

The docker image for the actions runner does not work. 
There are thousands of places where to create the token



The frontend sucks
Very slow
A lot of unnecessary stuff

buggy

very spread documentation with conflicting contents

WTF is going on with github pages? Are we still doing jekyll or not?
Are we keeping build artifacts in a branch?


WTF is the copilot CLI? Why is there no command allowlist (for ls and the likes)
Why can I not queue messages?

It also flickers badly

Why can I not enable new models from the CLI?
