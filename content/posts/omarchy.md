iso is very minimal
- not an actual omarchy installation
- will future isos have a GUI?

GUM for interface
- No fuzzy search, just arrow/vim keys

Look at
- Where does the keyboard selection data come from?

detecting network should be done in the background

git configuration is nice

Timezone has filter, nice

going back is not a thing

No dual boot, only entire drive is possible

Look into
- Does this use archinstall
- How does encryption work?
