# My experiences with Cline

Cline is an open-source AI-powered coding agent living in VS Code. I find VS
Code rather annoying to use compared to Neovim and Zed. Cline is the thing
making me keep a resource-hogging instance of VS Code open next to the other
two. 

KiloCode and Roo Code made it seem like Cline is basically Debian, very
conservative and purposefully behind in terms of features. 

From my experience that doesn't seem to be the case. Cline has the most or most
competend developers behind it compared to the other VS Code coders, and being
mostly upstream from them has some features earlier or plain better than the
others. 

I like the Question feature where I can select one of a few strategies the LLM
came up with.
