I struggle to come up with a single thing that GitHub wikis do better than
MkDocs Material or VitePress.
Why are they being kept in a separate repo?
Why are they kept in a separate repository?
Why does that repository reinvent the wheel by providing some of the web UI features that
normal source code repositories have, but in a worse way?

Wikis do not provide a global search, and the outline is hidden in one of the two
sidebars. They are quite slow and are restricted to what GitHub markdown
supports in terms of features.
