# Software features which got removed

> Hey, I was using that!

There is a list of features which I used to consider basic and to be taken for
granted which got removed and I to this day cannot understand why. 

## Android swipe between tabs

This used to be a part of the standard tab component and of any component
libraries and frameworks used for app development. 
Tabs used to live at the top, which admittedly is not a great place to reach on
a phone which you hold in your hand. But they're more visible there, less likely
to be covered by fingers. 
This problem was solved by allowing users to swipe left and right to switch
tabs. Every app used to have this. Youtube, the Clock app

## Notewise

This is hands down the best app for note taking in terms of the actual pen
engine. Suuuper fast, low latency, can take tons of vectors and I've never see
it slow down even a little bit. It looks and feels great, modern, easy to use,
minimal, with a lot of features. There's one problem though. Sometimes they just
remove features. The features don't look like they're full of technical debt or
taking up space in the UI. They're just gone one day
